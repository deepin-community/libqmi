The simple-tester-python program makes use of the 'libqmi-glib' library
through GObject Introspection.

The program will:
 * Open a connection to the qmi-proxy, or launch the qmi-proxy itself
   if it isn't already running.
 * Allocate a DMS client.
 * Query device capabilities.
 * Release DMS client.

The output will look like this:

$ ./simple-tester-python /dev/cdc-wdm0
max tx channel rate: 50000000
max rx channel rate: 100000000
data service:        non-simultaneous-cs-ps
sim:                 supported
networks:            gsm, umts, lte

Note that the program requires libqmi-glib to be installed in the system
and the introspection typelibs available in the standard paths.

Have fun!
